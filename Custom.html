   <p class="homep">Six years after this company was started we finally were able to start building custom bikes. It took alot of effort to find the right suppliers and backup suppliers. We also had to test out many sample products before finding the right companies to work with. With four years of experience and connection with the best people in this craft, we can say that you can put your trust in us to build you the best custom bike. Here are some reasons to build your own custom bike <a href="https://bildabike.com/5-benefits-of-buying-a-custom-bicycle/" target="_blank "> 5 Benefits of Building a Custom Bike</a> </p>
   <p class="homep">Our process starts by figuring out what specific bike style you looking for. Then the specialists inform you about all the main features in bikes. This way you can choose all the features you've wanted in a bike. Once we chose all your features we move on to the material of the bikes. We show you the different levels there are starting from basic to premium materials. After this, we go onto the last step which is styling the bike. This is mainly giving the bike different paint jobs and coatings We want to work around your price range and what you find most important</p>
   <p class="homep">After we show you all the examples and steps of the process we can finally start the build. We make sure to contact you after each step is finished before we move on to the next. We also work on your timeframe so there is no rush. Making sure that there are any changes you want to make and that everything looks good is our main priority. </p>
